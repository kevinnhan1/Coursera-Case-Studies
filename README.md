# Cyclistic : Google Data Analytics Case Study

## Scenario:
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

## About the company:
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.
One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,
and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers
who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

# Ask:
## The business task:
The business task in this case is to discover marketing strategies aimed at converting casual rides to annual riders. To achieve this, a few questions were asked:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Stakeholders
1. **Lily Moreno**: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns
and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.
2. **Cyclistic marketing analytics team:** A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and
reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy
learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic
achieve them.
3. **Cyclistic executive team:** The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the
recommended marketing program.
